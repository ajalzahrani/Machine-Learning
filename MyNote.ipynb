    "### What is EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA mean Exploratory Data Analysis. It is the process of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. EDA is used for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.\n",
